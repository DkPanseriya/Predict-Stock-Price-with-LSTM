# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This project aims to predict stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. We use historical stock prices to train the model and predict future prices.

## Features

- Load historical stock prices from CSV files.
- Train LSTM models on the stock prices.
- Visualize the training and validation results.
- Predict future stock prices based on the trained model.
